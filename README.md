# Random Dog Pictures üê∂

A project that was made while attempting to learn Java. Using Swing GUI & [Dog API](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/ "Dog Picture API"), the user clicks a button and receives an image of a dog along with that dog's breed. 

## What I learned? ‚ú®

* How to use NetBeans IDE for Swing GUI development. 
* Call and Parse JSON API's **(Using Java 11+ Method)**. 
* Setting Labels Icon with URL. 
* How much I appriciate [Intellij](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/ "IntelliJ IDE") (Using NetBeans was a pain, it was like writing code in google docs with colored text.)
* Pulling and beutifying URL substrings.
